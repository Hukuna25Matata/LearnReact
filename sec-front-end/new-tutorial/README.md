# React To-Do List App

This is a very simple React app built as part of my front-end learning tutorial. It allows users to:

- Add tasks to a list
- Delete individual tasks

## 🎯 Purpose

This app was created to demonstrate my learning in React basics using:
- `useState` hook
- Handling user input
- Conditional rendering
- Event handling in React

This is **different** from my previous project (Cricket Score Tracker) and fulfills the assignment requirement of completing a new 3+ hour front-end tutorial.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Basic CSS
